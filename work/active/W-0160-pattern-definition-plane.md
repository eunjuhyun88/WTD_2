# W-0160 — Pattern Definition Plane

## Goal

`Pattern Research Operating System`의 첫 contract family로 `/runtime/definitions/*` read model을 열어, built-in pattern library / registry metadata / capture-linked research evidence를 하나의 canonical pattern definition shape로 읽을 수 있게 한다.

## Owner

engine

## Primary Change Type

Contract change

## Scope

- `/runtime/definitions` list/detail read route 추가
- pattern library + registry metadata를 합친 canonical definition read model 추가
- `manual_hypothesis` capture `research_context`에서 thesis / tags / source / phase annotation evidence를 linked evidence로 노출
- runtime captures 와 첫 search-plane consumer 가 `definition_id` / `definition_ref`를 읽도록 contract 정렬
- research runs / benchmark search artifacts / handoff payload 가 `definition_ref`를 저장하도록 contract 정렬
- targeted engine tests 추가

## Non-Goals

- 새 definition write path 추가
- 별도 Postgres/SQLite definition table 도입
- app UI 연결
- promotion / outcome / judgment plane 구현

## Facts

1. current `runtime` plane already owns captures, setups, research contexts, and ledger reads, but it has no canonical `definitions` family yet.
2. built-in phase graphs already exist in `engine/patterns/library.py` and lightweight metadata already exists in `engine/patterns/registry.py`.
3. founder/manual hypothesis notes already land in canonical capture storage via `research_context`, including thesis, phase annotations, and research tags.
4. existing `/patterns/{slug}` read is pattern-engine oriented and does not present a runtime-plane definition object with linked research evidence.
5. current local cut adds `PatternDefinitionService` plus `/runtime/definitions` list/detail routes that compose pattern library, registry metadata, and capture-linked research evidence without adding a new write store.
6. current local cut also adds runtime capture-side `definition_ref` enrichment and `definition_id` filtering, so the first runtime consumer can read pattern definitions without depending on raw `pattern_slug` only.
7. current local cut also threads `definition_id` / `definition_ref` through corpus `seed` / `scan` route requests and candidate payloads without changing corpus ranking semantics.
8. current local cut now persists `definition_ref` on research runs and benchmark search artifacts, and includes it in benchmark-search handoff payload / selection metrics so the loop no longer terminates at search request metadata only.

## Assumptions

1. the first useful slice can stay read-only and derive definitions from existing stores instead of introducing new persistence.
2. linked evidence can come from recent captures with `research_context` for the same `pattern_slug` first.

## Open Questions

- whether future definition ids should stay slug/version-based or move to a separate durable UUID namespace.

## Decisions

- first slice is read-only: `list` + `detail` under `/runtime/definitions/*`.
- canonical detail shape will expose thesis, phase template, registry metadata, and linked evidence separately.
- capture `research_context` remains the evidence source for now; this slice does not migrate it out of captures yet.
- runtime capture consumers resolve `definition_ref` at read time; capture persistence remains `pattern_slug`/`pattern_version` based until a later write-path lane exists.
- the first search-plane cut is metadata-only: `definition_id` and `definition_ref` may flow through seed/scan requests and candidates, but they do not yet change corpus ranking semantics.
- research runtime persistence stays backward-compatible: `pattern_slug` remains the legacy join key, while `definition_ref` is added as an optional canonical key on runs, benchmark artifacts, and handoff payloads.

## Next Steps

1. decide whether definition ids remain slug/version derived or move to a durable UUID namespace once write paths land.
2. split capture-linked evidence from captures into a dedicated definition store only after the read contract proves stable.
3. extend `definition_ref` from benchmark-search artifacts into downstream promotion / judgment records so `definition -> search -> ledger` is traceable end-to-end.

## Exit Criteria

- runtime plane exposes canonical pattern definition list/detail routes.
- detail responses include phase template plus linked research evidence from captures when available.
- runtime captures, first search-plane consumers, and benchmark-search research artifacts all preserve canonical `definition_ref`.
- targeted engine tests pass.

## Handoff Checklist

- active work item: `work/active/W-0160-pattern-definition-plane.md`
- branch: `codex/w-0160-pattern-definition-plane`
- verification:
  - `uv run --directory engine python -m pytest tests/test_search_routes.py tests/test_runtime_routes.py tests/test_refinement_reporting.py tests/test_research_state_store.py tests/test_research_worker_control.py tests/test_pattern_search.py -q`
- remaining blockers: definition write path, durable definition store, downstream promotion/judgment records, and UI consumption remain future slices
